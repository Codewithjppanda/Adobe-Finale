## 🧪 How to Test

### Backend Test ✅
```bash
# Backend is running and healthy
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/storage/health"
# Response: {"healthy":true,"storage_types":{...}}

# Search API working correctly
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/search/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "text=test query&k=5"
# Response: {"matches":[]}
```

### Frontend Test 🎯
1. **Navigate to Reader**: `http://localhost:3000/reader`

2. **Upload PDFs**:
   - Use "Bulk Upload" for reference documents
   - Use "Upload & Read" for the PDF you want to read
   - Watch animated status indicators during upload/processing

3. **Test Text Selection**:
   - Select any text in the PDF viewer
   - Observe immediate feedback:
     - Blue selection banner appears instantly
     - "Searching for related sections..." with spinner
     - Results appear with success/no-results feedback
     - Status auto-clears after 2 seconds

4. **Test Different Scenarios**:
   - **Short selection** (< 3 chars): No search triggered
   - **Rapid selections**: Debounced to prevent spam
   - **No matches**: Shows "No related sections found"
   - **With matches**: Shows "Found X related sections"
